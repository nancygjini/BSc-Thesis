## Asymmetric GARCH effects and residual diagnostics: A finite-sample testing approach for multivariate linear models

This paper investigates the finite-sample residual-based tests for ARCH effects and serial dependency
designed by Dufour, Khalaf, and Beaulieu (2010), through an application to the Fama-
French Three-Factor Model (Fama & French, 1993), and a simulation experiment on assessing the
performance of the tests against asymmetric GARCH effects for Gaussian errors. The empirical
application reveals an acceptable model for 5-year sub-periods when allowing both Gaussian and
non-Gaussian errors, whereas the full sample model exhibits problematic residual diagnostics.
The simulation study shows that the asymmetry does not affect the performance of the tests
when compared to the symmetrical case. It however indicates a low power of the proposed tests
when allowing both symmetric and asymmetric GARCH effects, especially EGARCH, which are
commonly present in asset pricing models such as Fama-French, suggesting the case of underrejection
in the empirical application. Coming into such problematic conclusions on residual
diagnostics can be prevented by first testing for (asymmetric) GARCH effects in the residuals.
